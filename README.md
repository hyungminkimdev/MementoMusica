## About the Project
> 'MementoMusica' is an interactive app that helps a protagonist, who is gradually losing memories due to dementia, hold onto precious moments by allowing users to play meaningful music for them.

Music has always had a profound influence on our lives, often in ways we don't fully understand. I believe music holds an incredible, hidden power that can touch our emotions and memories in remarkable ways.

Dementia is a cruel illness that can erase even the most cherished memories with loved ones. Witnessing the struggles of those affected‚Äîboth patients and their families‚Äîmoved me to create an app that could offer comfort and healing through the power of music.

The story follows an aging man who slowly begins to forget the musical memories he shared with his beloved. However, as the user plays the guitar, fragments of his memories begin to resurface. This process is beautifully symbolized by Polaroid photos gradually coming into focus, representing the revival of his fading recollections.
